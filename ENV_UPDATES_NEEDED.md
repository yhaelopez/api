# Environment Updates Required

## ✅ Pusher PHP SDK Installed
The Pusher PHP server SDK is now installed successfully!

## 🔧 Environment Variables to Update

Add these lines to your `.env` file:

### 1. Change Broadcasting Driver
```env
# Change this line:
BROADCAST_CONNECTION=pusher
```

### 2. Add Frontend Pusher Variables
```env
# Add these new lines for the frontend:
VITE_PUSHER_APP_KEY=app-key
VITE_PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER=mt1
VITE_PUSHER_HOST=
VITE_PUSHER_PORT=
VITE_PUSHER_SCHEME=https
```

### 3. Your Existing Backend Variables (Already Set)
```env
# These are already in your .env:
PUSHER_APP_ID=app-id
PUSHER_APP_KEY=app-key
PUSHER_APP_SECRET=app-secret
```

## 🧪 For Local Testing
The test values (`app-id`, `app-key`, etc.) will work for local development.

## 🚀 For Production
You'll need real Pusher credentials from [pusher.com](https://pusher.com)

## 📝 Next Steps
1. Update your `.env` file with the above changes
2. Restart your development server: `./vendor/bin/sail up -d`
3. Test the notifications by creating/updating a user

## 🔍 Test Broadcasting
After updating .env, test with:
```bash
./vendor/bin/sail artisan tinker
```

Then in tinker:
```php
$user = App\Models\User::first();
Auth::login($user);
app(App\Services\InAppNotificationService::class)->success('Test', 'Hello World!');
```
